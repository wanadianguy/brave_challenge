# Bave Mini Challenge
## Context
This project was coded to realize the [mini challenge](https://bravecareer.notion.site/Mini-Challenge-Web-Scraper-for-Visitor-Classification-12966e26414d8047a44dc41fb4ad66d2) put in place by Brave in the context of a recrutement process.
## Applicant
- William DENORME

# Project
## Start the application
- Start a docker daemon
- Run `docker compose --profile all up -d` in a terminal
- Use a web browser to navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
## What's next? (possible improvements)
- Internationalize the scraper
- Use an AI instead of hard-coded data for the industries and questions. This AI would be trained by the app's users
- Use external resources (for the scrapper for instance)
- Make it a browser extension so that the app would collect all the websites the user has visited recently to make the form more personalized
- Collaborating with other companies to deliver surveys for them. For example, if a user browses a lot of phone websites, and Apple wants us to ask questions about the iPhone, we could recommend those questions to the user.

# Additional documents
I've added my resume and a recommendation letter from my previous employer to this project to support my application.
